# last-cursor-position package

:warning: I am looking for a maintainer for this project. It does not require a lot of work, but since I'm no longer using Atom, I always need to keep a developping environment just for fixing random issues that are found every few months, and I no longer want to do so. Please, let me know if you are interested in becoming the new project maintainer.

This package keeps a history of past cursor positions and allows to travel
back to them.

* `alt--` to travel to previous cursor position
* `alt-_` to undo previous travel
